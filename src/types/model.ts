/**
 * What the app works with once a pack is mounted.
 *
 * A pack stores a route as a four-item tuple and leaves the rest to the app; the old code then
 * assigned the derived values back into the tuple (`r[4]` key, `r[5]`/`r[6]` stars, `r[8]` length,
 * `r[9]` ordinal) and set a dozen fields on the crag object in place. Here those become named,
 * read-only fields computed once in src/core/packs/mount.ts, so nothing mutates shared state and
 * React and Redux can rely on identity.
